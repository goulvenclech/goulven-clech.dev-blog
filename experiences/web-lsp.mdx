import GithubInline from "$components/typography/GithubInline.astro"

A language server for the web, implementing the <i>Language Server Protocol</i>. It uses ~~HTMLlsrs~~ and CSSlsrs, our own language services designed to be integrated into language servers written in <i>Rust</i> or via <i>WebAssembly</i>. It's an open-source project, made with my friend <GithubInline user="3019731" />.
