## Contributing

Most of my blog entries express my personal views or experiences, so I don't expect any contribution to their content. But if you find a typo or a factual/ technical mistake, feel free to open an issue or a pull request, it will be appreciated ðŸ™‚

## MDX Components

I use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [Astro Components](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/) to write my blog entries. If you want more information on a component, each of them is well commented and (I hope) easy to understand, please refer to the [source code](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/tree/master/src/components).
