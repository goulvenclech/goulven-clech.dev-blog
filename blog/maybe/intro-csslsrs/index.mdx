## How it all started

Approximately 100% of programmers are typing code in a code editor. But surprisingly, editor tooling is an always overlooked aspect of the development process...

<p>Gladly, the web languages (HTML, CSS, and JS) are usually supported by default is most editors, with code completion, syntax highlighting, and other features... But still lacks features, and are desesperately slow.<side-note><SideImage src={ErikaNev} alt={"Myself sitting in the living room, working on \"Power Up!\" on a laptop, with board games visible in the background."} />We started this project in October 2024, when I was visiting Erika in Sweden.</side-note></p>

Editor tooling is usually provided by Language Servers, which are external programs that provide language-specific features to code editors. They are usually written in languages like Rust, Python, or Node.js, and communicate with the editor through the Language Server Protocol (LSP). They use Language Services behind the scene, which are libraries that provide language-specific features, like code completion, hover information, and diagnostics.

In our effort to create the perfect Web Language Server, we needed to start with a first language service...
