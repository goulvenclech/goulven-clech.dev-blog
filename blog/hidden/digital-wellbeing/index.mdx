## Before reading

**Warning:** I know that this subject can be guilt-inducing. Maybe you‚Äôre not feeling well, taking refuge in your digital life, found articles about ‚Äúdigital detoxes‚Äù online, and now you feel even more guilty.

In this entry, I'm sharing my personal path (incomplete and imperfect) to digital wellbeing. Not a list of objectives to achieve, not a way to be a "better person", not a way to be "more productive", not a way to "reconnect with nature", or whatever Youtube has tried to sell you... 

But I'm not a doctor, not a psychologist, and certainly not you. I don't know what you're going through, and I don't know what you need. For my part, I don't think I would have been able to make progress on this subject without the stability (personal and professional) that I currently have.

So if now it's not the right time, just close this tab, and take care üôÇ
