## Before reading

This is mostly for personal use. Sometimes I'll add a few notes, but sometimes I won't. I'm not trying to be exhaustive, but I'm both trying to keep a memory of the things I did, and to push myself to do new things.

## 2024

### March

- **Read**. "An elegant puzzle", by Will Shortz. Loved it. Most practical, down-to-earth, and useful management book I've read so far. And specifically dedicated to engineering management.
- **Watched**. TODO
- **Played**. Helldivers 2. Loved it. Buggy as hell, and probably liked by the wrost redditors... But it's just a ton of fun with friends.
- **Cooked**. Croque-monsieur, the old-fashioned way with béchamel and mustard. Liked it.
- **Visited**. TODO
- **Museum**. TODO
- **Date**. TODO

### February

- **Read**. "Tant que le café est encore chaud", by Toshikazu Kawaguchi. Loved it. Four stories easy to read, and really sweet and gentle.
- **Watched**. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World on Netflix. Was dog shit. So we watched the movie instead, and it was great.
- **Played**. Chants of Sennaar. Loved it. Under-exploited in many aspects, gives the answers too quickly, some languages are not very interesting, the ending moral is meh... But It was a sweet, poetic, and gripping short experience.
- **Cooked**. Lohikeitto (Finnish salmon soup), for the second time this year. Always a confort food.
- **Visited**. San Sebastian & Bilbao, Spain. Loved the food, the architecture, the landscapes.
- **Museum**. Guggenheim, Bilbao. Terrific architecture, and I absolutly loved "The Matter of Time" by Richard Serra. Third floor was interesting, if only for certain iconic works. Second floor was shit tho.
- **Date**. We visited the Musée Saint-Raymond, Toulouse, and coffee at La Fiancée. Thank the sun for being back.

### January

- **Read**. ???
- **Watched**. The Boy and the Heron, by Hayao Miyazaki. Loved it. Felt like the grumblings of an old man, worried about the lack of succession.
- **Played**. ???
- **Cooked**. I maked a yuzu-lemon tart for the first time, with yuzu from my own tree. Also made a Tartiflette. Loved both.
- **Visited**. ???
- **Museum**. Les Abattoirs, Toulouse. Meh this time.
- **Date**. Toulouse Cupping at La Belle Brune, tasting [https://www.slurp.coffee/en/](Slurp Coffee) beans.
