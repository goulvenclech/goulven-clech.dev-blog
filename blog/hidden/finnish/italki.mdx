### February 02 trial lesson

30 minutes trial lesson with Kassu, my first lesson on Italki.

She was very friendly and tried to make the best of our time. Mostly tried to understand my level, with some role playing and questions.

What I already knew but we practiced:
- "Ole" (to be) "Asun" (to live) 
- "Tuo" (that) "T√§m√§" (this) "Se" (it)
- Possessive pronouns: "Minun" (my) "Sinun" (your) "H√§nen" (his/her) "Meid√§n" (our) "Teid√§n" (your) "Heid√§n" (their)
- Possessive with "ole": "Minulla on" (I have) "Sinulla on" (you have) "H√§nell√§ on" (he/she has) "Meill√§ on" (we have) "Teill√§ on" (you have) "Heill√§ on" (they have)

What I learned:
- "Hauska tutustua" (litterally "funny to meet") for "nice to meet you"
- "Mit√§ kuuluu?" (litterally "What is heard?") for "how are you?"
- "Huonoa" (bad) / "Ihan hyv√§√§" (pretty good) / "Ei mit√§√§n ihmeellist√§" (nothing special)
- "Ent√§ sinulle?" (and you?)
- "Samoin" (same to you)
- "norppa" (seal) / sammakko (frog) / karhu (bear) / j√§nis (hare)
- difference between "-kin" and "myos" (both meaning "also")
- difference between "puhelin" (phone) and "k√§nnykk√§" (old mobile phone) and "√§lypuhelin" (smartphone)
