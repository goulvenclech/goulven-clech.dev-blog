### 2024-02-02 - Trial lesson with Kassu

30 minutes trial lesson with Kassu, my first lesson on Italki.

She was very friendly and tried to make the best of our time. Mostly tried to understand my level, with some role playing and questions.

What I already knew but we practiced:
- "Ole" (to be) "Asun" (to live) 
- "Tuo" (that) "Tämä" (this) "Se" (it)
- Possessive pronouns: "Minun" (my) "Sinun" (your) "Hänen" (his/her) "Meidän" (our) "Teidän" (your) "Heidän" (their)
- Possessive with "ole": "Minulla on" (I have) "Sinulla on" (you have) "Hänellä on" (he/she has) "Meillä on" (we have) "Teillä on" (you have) "Heillä on" (they have)


What I learned:
- "Hauska tutustua" (litterally "funny to meet") for "nice to meet you"
- "Mitä kuuluu?" (litterally "What is heard?") for "how are you?"
- "Huonoa" (bad) / "Ihan hyvää" (pretty good) / "Ei mitään ihmeellistä" (nothing special)
- "Entä sinulle?" (and you?)
- "Samoin" (same to you)
- "norppa" (seal) / sammakko (frog) / karhu (bear) / jänis (hare)
- difference between "-kin" and "myos" (both meaning "also")
- difference between "puhelin" (phone) and "kännykkä" (old mobile phone) and "älypuhelin" (smartphone)

As homeworks, a PDF "Goulven 2.2" with words to learn (removed what I already knew):
- Mökki (cottage)
- Juna (train)
- Metsä (forest)
- Reppu (backpack)
- Kauppa (shop)
- Marsu (guinea pig)
- Jäsen (member)
- Sveitsi (Switzerland)
- Noita (witch)
