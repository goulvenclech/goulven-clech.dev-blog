## Avant-propos

Blabla.

### Why ?

Personall blabla because I never start an article without a personnal story. That's my thing now.

The fun of learning a non-indo-european language.
-> Blabla.

Finland is a great country.
-> Blabla.

### It's easier than you think

Pronunciation
-> No stress or tones
-> No difficult sounds
-> One letter is one sound

Vowel harmony
-> Dispite the barbaric name, it's really easy to understand
-> Once mastered, it feels natural, and is a big part of the finnish's charm
-> Also, it help to spot agglutinated words

Grammar
-> Simple tense system (example: no future)
-> No gender nor articles (neither definite nor indefinite)
-> Coherent rules with few exceptions (and often in less used words)
-> "Cases" are not like in latin, with a lot of declensions. It's more like prepositions in english, but with suffixes.

Some similarities with Indo-European languages
-> Subject-Verb-Object order
-> Suffixes can often be translated to prepositions in english (example: "'s" or "of" in english is the genetiivi case in finnish)
-> Some words are loanwords from german, swedish, english, etc.

Aglutination is fun 
-> Seriously, it really is.

Finns are really happy when you try to speak their language
-> Even if you're bad, they will be happy to help you
-> A lot more ressources than it should be for a language with only 5 millions speakers.
-> Finns are really good at english, so you can ask them to explain you something in english if you don't understand.
-> Finns are really patient, polite and helpful. As a french, I'm impressed.

### Main difficulties (for me)

Vocabulary
-> Few transparent words appart from loanwords
-> Long words (aglutination but not only)

Plurals
-> Consonant gradation (KPT rule), old vs new words, exceptions...
-> Plural T vs (plural) partitive

Cases
-> Lot of cases, some are really close, some are used in specific context, and you have to apply them not only to nouns, but also to adjectives, pronouns, etc.

Spoken vs written
-> Spoken is really different from written, and it's hard to find resources for spoken finnish.
-> Numbers are really different in spoken and written finnish. AND that change depending on the region.
-> Dialects (like eastern finnish).

## First year (2023-2024)

From august 2023 to august 2024.

My goals :

1. Keep motivation high.
-> Plan a trip to Finland, and be able to speak with locals using minimal english.
-> A bit of finnish in my daily life, even when motivation and time are low.

2. Listening (a lot)
-> Like a child, immerged in the language. Even if I don't understand, I want to be used to the sounds and rythm of the language.
-> In English, I never made effort on the accent. I want to do it in finnish, so listening is the first step. 

### Duolingo

Started on august 2024.

Why ?
-> Free or cheap. Easy to use. Gamified.
-> "Streak" and league system push me to practice every day.
-> "Early bird" and "night owl" chests made me cut my practice in two sessions per day.

Does it work ?
-> Even if it's hard to see progress in short term, over months, some words and sentences are really natural to me.
-> The finnish course challenge you often with close word (in pronunciation or meaning).
-> It made you learn various vocabulary (animals, food, clothes, etc.) and regulary repeat them when you don't use them often.
-> It made me stay motivated, and I'm in a 200+ days streak (tbh that includes a few months learning english). So I'm sure finnish is part of my daily life now.

What's the limits ?
-> AI vocals are sometimes really bad.
-> Finnish is not a popular language, so there the course is very simple, and lack some tools like "tips" or "stories".
-> Some dated words or weid sentences. Examples: "kÃ¤nnykkÃ¤" (mobile phone) mostly used before smarphones.

False limits
-> No grammar explanations -> I don't thinks it's that important. Firstly, childs learn their language without grammar explanations at first. Secondly, you can find a lot of grammar explanations on the internet when you are curious or when you need it.
-> Very slow -> Probably, the App need your time to display adds or pay premium. But I don't care, Duolingo is the groundswell of my learning. When I have more time or energy, I add other ressources. But Duolingo ensure that I practice every day, and that's the most important thing.

### Netflix

Finnish content
-> Mostly noir and drama series, made in Finland. Other content are often not dubbed.
-> Except for child content, witch is good because it match my level.

Dual subtitles
-> Firefox extension "Netflix Bilingual Subtitles" allow me to display two subtitles at the same time.
-> I use finnish and english subtitles.

Content I watched
-> Hilda. A child serie, with a lot of fantasy words, but also a lot of everyday words. Very cute.

### Tutoring with Italki

Started on february 2024.

Why ?
-> Having a time for oral practice. With a native speaker, who can correct me.
-> Having a time for questions. When Youtube or Wikipedia are not enough, or when I want the opinion of a native speaker.

About Italki
-> From what I have read, it's one of the fairest platform for teachers. 
-> Website and app can be a bit confusing, but are mostly modern and easy to use.
-> More finnish teachers than I expected. With various prices and availabilities. I choose Kassu because she seems exprienced, have a lot of good reviews, speak a bit of french, and wasn't too expensive (some older teachers are really expensive).

Kassu
-> 2 lessons per month, 1 hour each.
-> She's a great teacher, who try to make the best of my time.
-> She use a lot of "role play" exercices, where we read a dialogue.
-> She also use some "games" where I have to thinks more.
-> Give me PDF and homeworks to do between lessons.


## My trip to Finland (fall 2024)
