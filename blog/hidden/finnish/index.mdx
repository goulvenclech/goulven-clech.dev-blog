## Avant-propos

Blabla.

### Why ?

Personall blabla because I never start an article without a personnal story. That's my thing now.

The fun of learning a non-indo-european language.
-> Blabla.

Finland is a great country.
-> Blabla.

### It's easier than you think

Pronunciation
-> No stress or tones
-> No difficult sounds
-> One letter is one sound

Vowel harmony
-> Dispite the barbaric name, it's really easy to understand
-> Once mastered, it feels natural, and is a big part of the finnish's charm
-> Also, it help to spot agglutinated words

Grammar
-> Simple tense system (example: no future)
-> No gender nor articles (neither definite nor indefinite)
-> Coherent rules with few exceptions (and often in less used words)
-> "Cases" are not like in latin, with a lot of declensions. It's more like prepositions in english, but with suffixes.

Some similarities with Indo-European languages
-> Subject-Verb-Object order
-> Suffixes can often be translated to prepositions in english (example: "'s" or "of" in english is the genetiivi case in finnish)
-> Some words are loanwords from german, swedish, english, etc.

Aglutination is fun 
-> Seriously, it really is.

Finns are really happy when you try to speak their language
-> Even if you're bad, they will be happy to help you
-> A lot more ressources than it should be for a language with only 5 millions speakers.
-> Finns are really good at english, so you can ask them to explain you something in english if you don't understand.
-> Finns are really patient, polite and helpful. As a french, I'm impressed.

### Main difficulties (for me)

Vocabulary
-> Few transparent words appart from loanwords
-> Long words (aglutination but not only)

Plurals
-> Consonant gradation (KPT rule), old vs new words, exceptions...
-> Plural T vs (plural) partitive

Cases
-> Lot of cases, some are really close, some are used in specific context, and you have to apply them not only to nouns, but also to adjectives, pronouns, etc.

Spoken vs written
-> Spoken is really different from written, and it's hard to find resources for spoken finnish.
-> Numbers are really different in spoken and written finnish. AND that change depending on the region.
-> Dialects (like eastern finnish).

## First year (2023-2024)

Blabla.

### Duolingo

Why ?
-> Free or cheap. Easy to use. Gamified.
-> "Streak" and league system push me to practice every day.
-> "Early bird" and "night owl" chests made me cut my practice in two sessions per day.

Does it work ?
-> Even if it's hard to see progress in short term, over months, some words and sentences are really natural to me.
-> The finnish course challenge you often with close word (in pronunciation or meaning).
-> It made you learn various vocabulary (animals, food, clothes, etc.) and regulary repeat them when you don't use them often.
-> It made me stay motivated, and I'm in a 200+ days streak (tbh that includes a few months learning english). So I'm sure finnish is part of my daily life now.

What's the limits ?
-> Slow. Really slow. (Maybe because they want you to pay/ watch ads longer?)
-> No grammar explanations.
-> AI vocals are sometimes really bad.
-> Finnish is not a popular language, so there the course is very simple, and lack some tools like "tips" or "stories".
