## What's the problem?

Elixir is a functional programming language, where the code is mainly organized as functions (duh!) and modules (a group of functions). However, the Elixir documentation doesn't give a lot of advice on how to organize a project, as expected from a general-purpose language.

The Phoenix documentation, Elixir's web framework, does offer a [directory structure example](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/directory_structure.html) for new projects, but it's mainly detailed for the front-end part (`/lib/hello_web/`). The back-end part (`/lib/hello/`) is mostly composed by "schemas" files (`feature.ex`, the data structure and its changesets) and "context" files (`features.ex`, a module with all the public functions). 

But our tiny [real-estate start-up](https://encheres-immo.com/) has grown over three years, with different developers and new features. Sadly, our back-end directory structure hasn't evolved with it and has become a mess.

To be honest, I am extensively to blame for this situation. After the departure of the company's first developer, I remained alone as a junior developer. With the intention of recruiting another CTO, I maintained the project's initial philosophy as long as possible and delayed making essential architectural decisions.

Even as recruitment difficulties became apparent, it took me some time to step up as the tech lead. I suffered through the situation, which seemed beyond my control. And when we compensated with freelancers/ interns, I didn't dare nor know how to manage them correctly, leading to less coherent or qualitative code.

Today, the situation is different, as I gradually regained control of the project and built my confidence. I have built a team of five people, including three software developers, destined to grow. And now, it is time to re-organize our project üí™

### Inconsistent structures

<Asterism />

Let's consider an extract of the old structure : 

```
encheres_immo/
‚îú‚îÄ accounts.ex <- multi-schemas context
‚îú‚îÄ accounts/
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ user.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ organization.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ formula.ex <- child schema
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... utils]
‚îú‚îÄ auctions.ex <- context
‚îú‚îÄ auctions/
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ projections/
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ auction.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... utils]
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ currency.ex <- child schema
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... utils]
‚îú‚îÄ contacts/
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ contacts.ex <- context
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ contact.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... utils]
[...]
‚îú‚îÄ application.ex <- app life cycle
‚îú‚îÄ release.ex <- utils for migrations and seeding
‚îî‚îÄ [... repo related files]
```

If we can identify three contexts in this example (`accounts`, `auctions`, and `contacts`), their inconsistent structure makes the whole project hard to understand.

Additionally, some of these directory structures simply don't work. For example, instead of `users` and `organizations` context with their related functions, we have an abnormally long and messy `accounts.ex`. Worse, some schemas file, like `user.ex` and `organization.ex`, contain some functions that should also be in context.

This situation arose from poorly documented personal logic, followed by various developers interpreting it in their own way. We can guess the origin of some problems: 
1. The initial developer aimed to group account functions together, but their number made this file unreadable.
2. Another developer (maybe me) wanted to reduce this file by putting the simplest functions with their schema, making unclear if a function should be in the context or with the the schema.
3. With an absurdly big "accounts" folder next to a small "contacts" folder, it's now unclear when a feature should have its folder. This decision became at the discretion of each developer.
4. Let that sink for a few years and ta-da!  


## Main considerations

Before starting to iterate, I knew my solution had to address several considerations.

First, our system should be versatile enough to cover all existing and future features, while remaining consistent. It should also allow scaling small subfeatures into larger ones.

Second, "What is conceived well is expressed clearly". If good readability and consistency are the main objectives, this should make our solution easy to document and, therefore, easy to enforce. A few paragraphs explaining key concepts and a structure diagram should be enough.

Finally, I want to involve the current team as much as possible in decision-making. This approach will not only lead to a better solution but also ensure that the entire team is familiar with the solution, making it easier to implement initially.

## Three errors to avoid

We made several iterations before finding the right one. Some were deliberately radical and helped us to identify wrong directions.

### Nesting hell

Here is our initial proposal based on [this article](https://dev.to/pedromtavares/blazing-with-phoenix-project-structure-463l), with some personal modifications. Each feature is in a folder, inside its parent feature, and so on, following the schema relations.

```
encheres_immo/
‚îú‚îÄ accounts/
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ accounts.ex <- multi-schemas context
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ organizations/
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ organizations.ex <- context
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ organization.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ formulas/
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ formulas.ex <- child context
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ formula.ex <- child schema
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... other child folders]
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ users/
‚îÇ         ‚îú‚îÄ users.ex <- context
‚îÇ         ‚îú‚îÄ user.ex <- schema
‚îÇ         ‚îî‚îÄ [... other child folders]
[...]
‚îú‚îÄ application.ex <- app life cycle
‚îú‚îÄ release.ex <- utils for migrations and seeding
‚îî‚îÄ [... repo related files]
```

This solution has several advantages:  fewer files at the root, coherent structures throughout, and allowing multi-schema contexts (if necessary). Also, module names follow schema relations:

```
EncheresImmo.Accounts.Organizations.Formulas.Formula
Lib -> Parent -> Parent -> Context -> Schema
```

One of the downsides of this solution is that it may result in more and more folders nested inside folders, making it challenging to access deeply nested files. With time, module names will be longer and harder to guess, such as : `EncheresImmo.Accounts.Organizations.PaymentInfos.Cards.Card`.

Finally, complex relations like `Users`-`Orgs` or many-to-many tables can be tricky to represent as a nested hierarchy.

### Scrolling hell

<Asterism />

For thought, we can try the opposite approach:

```
encheres_immo/
‚îú‚îÄ organizations/
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ organizations.ex <- context
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ organization.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... utils]
‚îú‚îÄ formulas/
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ formulas.ex <- context
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ formula.ex <- schema
‚îú‚îÄ users/
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ users.ex <- context
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ user.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... utils]
[...]
‚îú‚îÄ application.ex <- app life cycle
‚îú‚îÄ release.ex <- utils for migrations and seeding
‚îî‚îÄ [... repo related files]
```

Like the previous solution, we clean files at the root and get a coherent structure throughout. But this time, every schema has its folder with context/schema/utils, making module names easy to guess.

```
EncheresImmo.Users.User
Lib -> Context -> Schema
```

However, there are drawbacks to this solution, including a potentially large number of folders at the root level, with no clear distinction between the central feature and the small sub-feature. Also, folder structure and module names do not represent schema relations. 

### Messy hell

<Asterism />

My colleague tried two solutions, which can be summarized as follows:

```
encheres_immo/
‚îú‚îÄ accounts/
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ accounts.ex <- multi-schemas context
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ custom_themes.ex <- context
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ schema/
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ organization.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ user.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ custom_theme.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... other schemas]
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... utils]
‚îú‚îÄ contacts/
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ contacts.ex <- context
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ schema/
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ contact.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... utils]
[...]
‚îú‚îÄ application.ex <- app life cycle
‚îú‚îÄ release.ex <- utils for migrations and seeding
‚îî‚îÄ [... repo related files]
```

This architecture features less nesting compared to the first proposal and fewer folders than the second one. Additionally, It makes a clearer distinction between context files and schema files, and allows multi-schemas context.

However, I don't think there is a necessity for multi-schemas contexts, such as `Accounts`. Upon reviewing our code, such functions would either belong in a distinct context or are poor programming practices.

Moreover, this solution does not distinguish schemas/contexts associated with more extensive features. When we multiply subsidiary schemas/contexts, this quickly leads to a messy folder:

```
encheres_immo/
‚îú‚îÄ accounts/
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ accounts.ex <- multi-schemas context
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ custom_themes.ex <- context
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ formulas.ex <- context
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ payment_infos.ex <- context
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ [... other contexts]
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ schema/
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ organization.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ custom_theme.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ formula.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ payment_info.ex <- schema
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... other schemas]
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ [... utils]
[...]
```

## Our final proposal

Not the miracle solution, but I think I found one halfway of all our solutions:

```
encheres_immo/
‚îú‚îÄ organizations/ <- a folder for each feature
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ organizations.ex <- context 
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ organization.ex <- schema & changesets
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ ? - utils/ <- utils folder
‚îÇ    ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ [... utils].ex <- utils files 
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ ? -  formula/ <- subfolder for each child feature
‚îÇ            ‚îú‚îÄ formula.ex <- child schema & changesets
‚îÇ            ‚îú‚îÄ ? - formulas.ex <- child context 
‚îÇ            ‚îî‚îÄ ? - [... utils] <- child utils 
[...]
‚îú‚îÄ application.ex <- app life cycle
‚îú‚îÄ release.ex <- utils for migrations and seeding
‚îî‚îÄ [... repo related files]
```

A "Feature" is a data structure (example: `user`), with a schema (and changesets), a context (functions to create/ use/ modify/ delete it), utils (optional - additional functions, boilerplates, templates, or behaviours), and child features (optional - embed or small tables).

A "Child feature" is a simple schema/ embed (example: `formula`) with few to none context functions, and few to none utils. A child feature can't have a child feature itself. If a child feature grows into a feature, we should transfer it to its own folder. 

The primary benefit of this solution is its ease of documentation, requiring just one schema and two paragraphs to explain. Furthermore, despite its straightforward approach, it stays versatile enough to ensure compatibility with our existing codebase.

Additionally, even if the module name doesn't fully describe the entire hierarchy as the first proposal does, it still enables us to grasp the module's immediate relationships. And it remains concise and straightforward to deduce, like the second proposal :

```
EncheresImmo.Organizations.Formulas.Formula
Lib -> Feature -> Subfeature -> Schema
```

Drawbacks include the eventual proliferation of folders at the root, but this should stay slower than the second proposal and without the nesting (seen in the first proposal) or messy (noted in the third proposal) issues. Finally, if this method requires adjustments to the folder structure each time a sub-feature is upgraded to a main feature, those instances should be rare.

### About test files

<Asterism />

Let's quickly talk about test files, as I've intentionally skipped the subject so far.

To respect our legacy code, we'll maintain a `test/` folder at the project's root. This includes a `test_helper.exs` file and a `support/` folder for shared test functions. `test/` (alike `lib/`) is split between `encheres_immo/` and `encheres_immo_web/` folders for back-end and front-end parts respectively. This approach, while not my initial choice, is the best compromise between respecting the existing code and making it evolve. It‚Äôs also aligned with the structure to which other developers are accustomed, as recommended by the Phoenix documentation.

For my personal project, I plan to explore a slightly different structure: regroup the tests on one feature with the other related files, by creating a `[feature name]-test.exs` file in the folder of each feature. I will see if it's possible to make it work, but I think it can improve modularity, readability, and maintenance. 

## About the decision process

As I said in the introduction, this is one of my first big decisions as a tech lead. I wanted to involve the team in the process, not only to make a better decision or for democratic management, but also to reassure myself.

It was also the first opportunity to formalize my decision process, and I knew that writing would play a central part. Of course, some discussions happened in meetings, but I tried to keep a written trace of it, so I created a GitHub Issue. 

There are multiple benefits in using GitHub Issues. Firstly, these issues are stored in the repository, making them easily accessible. Additionally, writing allows us to express our thoughts clearly, illustrate them with examples, and review proposals from others. By doing so, we can see the progression of the discussion and how we reached the final decision.

<FigImage src={ImageIssue} alt="Screenshot of the GitHub Issue" caption="Don't be afraid to write long messages!" />

We took a few days to discuss the proposal and make the necessary changes, but the effort paid off. By involving everyone, we made a more informed decision that everyone knows about. More oral meetings or rushing the decision alone would not have saved time in the long run.

At the conclusion of our discussions, we have to write down and document our decisions. As this affects the entire project scope, we added the schema and the two paragraphs above in our `README.md`. If the decision was related to a specific feature, we'll document it within the `@moduledoc` of the feature's context file, ensuring relevance and easy access.


## What I learned

This work not only enhanced the day-to-day experience of all developers on the project, but it allowed me to grow both as a developer and tech lead.

Firstly, the journey from navigating a convoluted project structure to a clean, coherent, and balanced architecture taught me the value of versatility in project design. This middle ground proved to be a sustainable solution, marrying simplicity with scalability.

Moreover, the iterative process really helped me understand each approach's strengths and weaknesses. By examining the problem from multiple perspectives, seeking out new ideas online, and testing them on our codebase... I learned a lot about the language, about project design, but also about my own project!

Finally, the decision-making process highlighted the importance of transparency and active team participation. Using GitHub Issues for documentation promoted clarity, made sure every team member could share their thoughts, and kept everyone aware of the final decision.

It also gave me confidence in my ability to make important decisions for this project, even when it requires reworking the entire architecture.

### Possible improvement

<Asterism />

Looking back, there are a few things that we could have done better :

- **Formalizing the Process.** Adopting a standardized template for Request For Comments (RFC) issues will streamline our discussions when we are working on a big feature or a deep rework. This template should include sections for the issue description, proposed solution, alternatives considered, and the anticipated impact.

- **Facilitating Engagement.** Starting the talk with a set of prepared questions could make it easier for everyone to get involved and share their thoughts. As stated before, involving as many developers as possible not only improves the quality of the solution, but makes it known and understood by everyone.

- **Documentation and Testing from the Start.** Opening a Pull Request (PR) alongside the issue, containing an initial draft of the documentation and key test files, will allow us to visualize and refine our ideas through tangible examples. This approach not only facilitates more concrete feedback but also ensures that the documentation and tests evolve alongside the decision-making process. It will also make the job easier for the developer developing the solution afterward.

We'll see if these strategies can make our decision-making and documentation better, while fostering a more collaborative and efficient environment... Or if they will slow down and complicate our decision process.

See you on the next RFC issue! üìúüßê
