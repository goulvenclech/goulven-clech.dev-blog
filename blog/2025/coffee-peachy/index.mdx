## Basics of speciality coffee

T**he pandemic has changed our morning coffee**. By revealing how deeply our daily routines impact our mental health and well-being, it inspired many of us to explore *specialty coffee* for the first time.

Two years ago, to show that it can be much more than a bitter pick-me-up, I shared my own journey in <a href="/2023/discovering-coffee-toulouse/">*Discovering Coffee in Toulouse*</a>. Since then, I've continually been amazed by all the passionate people, amazing events, and delicious coffees I've encountered. Even more gratifying, my beginner’s gear recommendations have encouraged a few newcomers to dive into this fascinating world.

Yet, I understand that specialty coffee can seem intimidating, filled with obscure terms and concepts that might seem a bit snobbish. That's why I'm excited to share more of what I've learned, beginning with my personal cheat sheet—a quick guide to help you better understand, buy, and enjoy coffee.

I hope you find it helpful!

### A brief history

<Asterism />

<draft-section>

Talk briefly about its discovery, usage throughout history.

Then how it became a global commodity.

Then the three waves of coffee, and how specialty coffee is the third wave.

### Beans' journey

<Asterism />

Coffee *cherries*—the fruit containing our precious beans—grow on trees from the *Coffea* family, whose main representatives are *Coffea arabica* and *Coffea canephora* (commonly known as *robusta*). Other species make up only a small percentage of global coffee production.<sup>1</sup><side-note class="xl:-mt-8">1 — Honorable mention for *Coffea liberica*, once cultivated for its resistance to fungal diseases, but now only marginally grown in certain parts of West Africa and Southeast Asia; And *Coffea stenophylla*, a long forgoten West African species, which has recently drawn attention for its promising cup quality and natural heat tolerance, making it a potential candidate for climate-resilient coffee ☞ <a href="https://youtu.be/iGL7LtgC_0I">About Stenophylla</a></side-note>

Coffea arabica requires a relatively warm climate without frost, but with abundant rainfall, good ventilation, and cool nights. These conditions are primarily found at higher altitudes, in mountains or tropical plateaus, as well as on some islands within the *coffee belt*—between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. This climate slows cherry maturation, promoting the development of fine and complex aromas.

Less demanding, robusta coffee grows at lower altitudes (200 to 800 meters) where temperatures can reach up to 30°C. It also withstands higher humidity, diseases, and climatic variations. These traits make robusta well-suited to hot and humid tropical plains, particularly in West Africa and Southeast Asia. But less aromatic and higher in caffeine, robusta is primarily used to cut costs in industrial coffee blends.

*Harvests* can be handpicked—essential for specialty coffee—or mechanical, quicker but less precise. After harvesting, cherries undergo *processing*, a critical step that shapes the coffee's final flavor profile. They can be fully washed to remove their skin and pulp, dried naturally in the sun with their pulp still intact, or fermented in tanks to enhance flavors. The drying process typically involves spreading cherries or beans on raised beds, patios, or mechanical dryers, carefully managed to achieve consistent moisture levels essential for quality.<side-note class="xl:-mt-100"><SideImage src={FarmerDryingCoffee} alt="Farmer drying coffee" />A farmer is drying coffee beans in the sun. Antigua, Guatemala, Central America.</side-note>

Once processed, coffee beans are carefully sorted and selected based on quality criteria such as size, density, and defect levels. Specialty coffee buyers often visit farms or cooperatives directly to taste and evaluate beans before purchase. Beans are then packaged and transported—usually by sea—to roasters around the world.

### Economics of coffee

<Asterism />

Often, people visiting specialty coffee shops for the first time are surprised to see an espresso priced over 2€, compared to the 1.50€ they'd pay at a chain, or 0.50€ at a vending machine. But considering the steps, the people involved, and kilometers traveled, how can coffee remain this cheap and still be sustainable? It simply can't.

After the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement's *quota system* in 1989, the removal of export quotas unleashed massive stockpiles and encouraged aggressive production expansions—especially in Brazil and Vietnam. This surge drove coffee prices to historically low levels, often below production costs.<sup>1</sup> Although occasional price spikes occurred due to severe weather events,<sup>2</sup> coffee prices have consistently failed to keep pace with global inflation. As a result, real prices steadily declined over three decades, creating an economic crisis for millions of smallholder coffee farmers, especially in Latin America and Africa.<sup>3</sup><side-note class="xl:-mt-64 draft"><SideImage src={CoffeePricesHistorical} alt="ça monte pas" />1 — TODO: make a graph with the evolution of <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2535/coffee-prices-historical-chart-data">coffee prices</a> between 1980 and 2010. With a vertical line for the 1989 collapse and gray areas for price spikes.</side-note><side-note>2 — Such as in 1994, 1997, and 2010.</side-note><side-note>3 — « [...] although the coffee business is booming in consuming developed countries, current rock bottom prices are causing immense hardship to countries where coffee is a key economic activity, as well as to the farmers who produce it. » ☞ Osorio N (2002). *The coffee crisis: a threat to sustainable development*. International Coffee Organization <a href="https://www.ico.org/documents/ed1849.pdf">Source</a></side-note>

Despite this « silent crisis », no global coffee price crisis visibly disrupted consumer markets before the COVID-19 pandemic. But then, coffee prices have surged to historic highs by 2025<sup>4</sup> due to climatic, economic, and geopolitical factors. Climatically, the 2021 severe frost in Brazil, the 2023 drought in Vietnam, and the 2024 poor harvests in Indonesia have significantly reduced coffee yields, especially for robusta. Economically, sustained global demand, heightened market speculation, and rising costs for fertilizers, energy, and shipping—exacerbated by the war in Ukraine—have further inflated prices. Although a moderate price easing is anticipated beyond 2025, the long-term outlook remains volatile due to ongoing climate risks and sustained demand growth, especially in emerging markets (e.g., China, India).<sup>5</sup><side-note class="draft">4 — TODO: make a graph with the evolution of <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2535/coffee-prices-historical-chart-data">coffee prices</a> between 2010 and 2025.

price developments*. FAO <a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/b7f6d358-01b9-4545-876f-962382d71af9">Source</a></side-note>

Of course, specialty coffee isn't immune to these challenges: roasters and farmers have to face rising production, labor, and living costs, and profound changes and investments will be necessary to tackle climate change. But by prioritizing quality over quantity, specialty coffee supports more sustainable practices and encourages a healthier market dynamic, benefiting farmers, consumers, and the environment alike. And I believe that worths paying a bit more for a cup of coffee.

### Health impacts

<Asterism />

In addition to being economically and environmentally sustainable, coffee must also be safe for us. And if caffeine was once feared and wrongly blamed for a range of health issues, over the past two decades, scientific research has brought a major shift in how coffee is viewed nutritionally.

Large-scale studies and meta-analyses suggest that moderate coffee consumption (typically 2 to 4 cups a day) is linked to a lower risk of several chronic diseases,<sup>1</sup> including type 2 diabetes,<sup>2</sup> heart diseases,<sup>3</sup> and even some forms of cancer.<sup>4</sup> There's also growing evidence that regular coffee drinkers may have a reduced risk of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease.<sup>5</sup>
<side-note class="xl:-mt-60">1 — Individuals with higher coffee intake had a 14% reduction risk for all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.92) ☞ Je Y, Giovannucci E (2014). *Coffee consumption and total mortality: a meta-analysis of twenty prospective cohort studies*. Br J Nutr <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24279995/">Source</a></side-note><side-note class="xl:-mt-24">2 — Approximately 4 cups of coffee per day is associated with a 21% reduction in all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.72-0.87) ☞ Shahinfar & al (2021). *Coffee consumption and cardiovascular diseases and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of cohort studies*. Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34112583/">Source</a></side-note><side-note>3 — Approximately 3 cups of coffee or tea per day is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases and improved survival ☞ Chieng D, Kistler PM (2022). *Coffee and tea on cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention*.

Eur J Cancer Prev <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28288025/">Source</a></side-note><side-note>5 — Approximately 3 cups of coffee per day was linked to a 28% lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.65-0.81) ☞ Qi H, Li S (2014). *Dose-response meta-analysis on coffee, tea and caffeine consumption with risk of Parkinson's disease*. Geriatr Gerontol Int <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23879665/">Source</a></side-note>

These associations don't necessarily prove that coffee causes these health benefits, but the consistency of the findings across many different populations and study designs makes the evidence quite robust. Researchers also point to biological mechanisms that may explain these effects, including the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and insulin-sensitizing properties of compounds naturally present in coffee.

Of course, coffee isn't risk-free. It can interfere with your sleep,<sup>6</sup> increase anxiety,<sup>7</sup> and — during pregnancy — raise the risk of low birth weight or miscarriage.<sup>8</sup> But for the average healthy adult, the current consensus is clear: <u>coffee is more likely to benefit your health than to harm it.</u><side-note>6 — Caffeine consumption significantly reduces sleep quality by shortening total sleep time, lowering efficiency, and increasing time to fall asleep and nighttime wakefulness. To avoid these effects, it should be consumed 9-13 hours before bedtime, depending on the dose. ☞ Gardiner C & al (2023). *The effect of caffeine on subsequent sleep: A systematic review and meta-analysis*.

## Tasting coffee

When you start improving your tasting skills, it's easy to feel intimidated or self-conscious. We've all seen those videos where a wine taster—after a near-liturgical sequence of swirling, sniffing and sipping—magically pinpoint the exact region and vintage, and describe it with a florid flood of adjectives.

But when you demystify this image, you realise those ritualised steps are simply techniques professionals use to improve consistency between tastings, to help comparisons. Then, thanks to their daily exposure to numerous wines, sommeliers can identify and interpret all the subtle clues that make each wine unique: strong tannins paired with vibrant colour might suggest youth, while higher alcohol levels and taste of jammy fruits can point to warmer climates, etc. Finally, the complex vocabulary they employ is simply professional jargon, a specialised language like all fields have, allowing experts to communicate precisely and efficiently.

Yet, few of these advanced skills are essential for amateurs. While training your palate can help clarify your preferences, you certainly don't need exhaustive regional knowledge. Similarly, improving your ability to articulate your experience makes sharing your passion more enjoyable, but you don't need professional-level precision.

Ultimately, developing your tasting skills should mainly be about enjoying your coffe, and sharing that pleasure with others!

### Tastes, aromas, and flavors

<Asterism />

To better understand the tasting process, it's essential to clearly distinguish between « *taste* » and « *aromas* ». Simply put, taste refers to the basic sensations perceived by our tongue—sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. On the other hand, aromas are perceived through our nose, capturing the volatile compounds that give coffee its rich, layered bouquet—those floral, fruity, nutty, or chocolaty nuances we love.<sup>1</sup><side-note class="draft xl:-mt-5">1 — TODO: make a screenshot and an explaination about the page 82/83 of the Nez #5 magazine</side-note>

Together, taste and aromas form what sensory science calls « *flavours* ».<sup>2</sup> But flavours are even broader: they're a blend of our direct sensory impressions combined with the context and experience around the drink. When you sip your coffee, everything from temperature and texture to your mood, expectations, the setting, and even cultural habits influence your perception.<sup>3</sup> Drinking an espresso in a lively café among friends can taste profoundly different from drinking the exact same coffee alone, at home.<sup>4</sup><side-note class="xl:-mt-28">2 — This review of eleven recent multidisciplinary papers, dissect how volatile aromas, non-volatile taste compounds, genetics and processing conditions interact to create the overall flavour of foods ☞ Chen et al (2023). *Food Perception: Taste, Smell and Flavour*. Foods <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/19/3628">Source</a></side-note><side-note>3 — In a cross-sectional study of 345 volunteers, the perceived intensity of sweet, sour, salty, and bitter tastes was significantly higher among Hispanic and African-American participants compared to Caucasian participants—especially for men ☞ Dotson et al. (2016). *Exploring Ethnic Differences in Taste Perception*. Chem Senses <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26994473/">Source</a></side-note><side-note>4 — Cognitive-neuroscience research show that flavour emerges from the brain's integration of visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and gustatory signals; and demonstrates experimentally that changing contextual cues—such as lighting, colour, music, or tableware—systematically shifts the flavour we perceive ☞ Spence C (2020). *Multisensory flavor perception: A cognitive neuroscience perspective*. Multisensory Perception <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128124925000103">Source</a></side-note>

This complexity explains why, in specialty coffee like in wine tasting, we describe « *notes* ». When we speak about notes of strawberry, caramel, or jasmine, we don't mean the coffee literally tastes exactly like those foods. Instead, we're referencing memory snapshots of those flavours, subtle reminders or echoes that our brain associates with previous tasting experiences.

These notes become clearer and more precise with practice. Regularly and mindfully tasting and comparing different coffees enriches your sensory vocabulary, enhancing your ability to detect subtle aromas, recalling flavour memories, and expressing your experience in words.

### Tasting at coffee shops

<Asterism />

Are you ready to start your journey? The easiest way is to type « speciality coffee » on Google Maps (or your favorite map app) and find the nearest coffee shop. If you already known a speciality roaster, ask if they run their own café counter, and if they supply any place in your area.

Speciality coffee shops often don't look like your traditional café, but don't be intimidated! They are usually small but cozy, with a minimalist design and a focus on quality. Most of the time, you have to order at the counter—especially if the place don't offers meals or brunches—and then you can sit down and enjoy! Most places will let you stay as long as you want, and even work on your laptop, as long as you don't hog the table during rush hours (usually lunch time and weekends) and you order something.

If you're not sure what to order, don't hesitate to ask the barista for recommendations. They are usually very friendly, passionate about coffee, and happy to share their knowledge. But let's cover the basics to help you navigate:

In third-wave coffee shops, you can expect most milk beverages to be made with micro-foamed milk—steamed milk with a velvety texture and tiny bubbles—usually topped with latte art. You can also expect alternative options such as oat, almond, or soy milk.

In more traditional cafés, the milk typically separates into two layers: a thick cap of large-bubble foam on top, and liquid milk beneath.<sup>1</sup> For some beverages, the foam layer may be thicker (cappuccino) or thinner (flat white). Latte art is often absent or replaced by a dusting of cocoa powder. In French or French-inspired cafés, milk is often not steamed; a macchiato becomes a « café noisette » (referring to its hazelnut colour), a flat white becomes a « café crème » or « café au lait », and cappuccinos often have chocolate milk or even whipped cream. Generally, these dated elements are not a sign of quality coffee…<side-note class="xl:-mt-34">1 — The World Barista Championship used to judge the cappuccino by measuring the foam height. Since 2016, catching up with the new trends, the « cappuccino course » has been replaced by the « milk beverage course », made from a single shot of espresso and steamed milk, allowing competitors more flexibility in choosing a coffee-to-milk ratio that showcases their coffee best ☞ <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160407234207/http://www.worldcoffeeevents.org/evolving-the-wbc-2016/">Archive</a></side-note>

Finally, coffee shops almost always offer non-coffee beverages, such as teas, hot chocolates, chai, matcha... Or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_cherry_tea">cascara</a>, an infusion of dried coffee cherries, which has a fruity and slightly sweet flavor!

### Tasting at home

<Asterism />

<draft-section>

Do I really like it? What do I like about it? What do I dislike about it?

It's just bitter, sour, and woody? -> Maybe try speciality coffe, read my previous article.

I buy speciality coffee, but it's:
- Bitter -> Grind coarser, brew shorter.
- Sour -> Grind finer, brew longer.
- Watery -> Brew longer.
- Too strong -> Brew shorter.
- Too fermented/boring -> Try another process.
- Woody -> Try another roaster.

Reads the notes on the label, and try to find what the roaster meant.

### Tasting at cuppings

<draft-section>

Blablabla. Why and how to find cuppings in your area.

White cups with numbers (to avoid bias). Smell the dry coffee. Smell the wet coffee. Break the crust. Clean the cup. Smell again. Taste. Spit. Rate.

Recipe: 8.25g coffee, 150g water, 96°C, 4 minutes.

Tutorial on how to break the crust and clean the cup.

No good or wrong answer. Don't overthink the first sip. Opinions come from comparison, so try the second one and ask yourself :

- Do I like it?
- Is it more acidic than the previous one?
- Is it more bitter?
- Is it more sweet?
- Is it fermented?

From there, you can even try to put words on what you taste.

- If it's acidic and sweet, is it fruity? Like stone fruits or berries?
- If it's more acidic than sweet, is it more like citrus or like vinegar?
- If it's more bitter than sweet, is it more like chocolate or like burnt toast?
... etc.

Use the coffee wheel to help you find the right words.

## Buying coffee

<draft-section>

Blablabla. You can buy speciality coffee online, even on subscription format. It's useful if you are not in a big city, but it's also nice to go buy locally, and met your local scene.

Specialty coffee can be buy directly from roasters, which often have a counter or a coffee shop. You can also find it in specialty coffee shops, which often sales their roasters coffee, or a selection of roasters. I avoid coffees in supermarkets or convenience stores, as they are often low-quality coffee.

Look « speciality coffee » on Google Maps, and you will find a lot of shops. There is also dedicated websites, like <a href="https://europeancoffeetrip.com/">European Coffee Trip</a>, which offers a more selective list but sometimes outdated.

### How to read a coffee label

<Asterism />

Before I dig into the label, I first scan the bag for quick cues that tell me whether it's worth a closer look. For example, here what I look for:

| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-success rounded-full inline-block" /> Green flags | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| Precise origin | More than just a country, but a region, a farm, or even a lot. Indicates a transparent supply chain and a single origin coffee. |
| Variety | Not useful for the average consumer, but indicates a transparent supply chain and a single origin coffee. |
| Processing method | Indicates the coffee's flavor profile, and the care taken in its production. |
| Roast date | Indicates the coffee's freshness. Industrial coffee often has a "best before" date, which is not the same. |
| Resealable zipper | Coffe is sensitive to air, light, and moisture. A resealable zipper helps preserve freshness. |
| Gas release valve | Freshly roasted coffee releases CO2, A gas release valve allows it to escape without letting air in. |
| Notes | If related to fruits, flowers, deserts, dairy products, or alcohols. Indicates a clean and complex coffee. |

Some cues aren't automatically good or bad, but are worth noting:

| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-warning rounded-full inline-block" /> Orange flags | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| Intensity scale | Purely subjective, and often misleading. |
| Roast color | Somehow subjective, and often misleading. |
| Altitudes | Useless information, and often misleading. |
| Blends | Can be great, but often used to hide low-quality coffee. |
| Notes | If related to chocolate, caramel, nuts, spices, or sweetness. May indicate a burnt coffee. |

On the other hand, a few signals almost always make me put the bag back on the shelf:

| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-primary rounded-full inline-block" /> Red flags | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| Robusta | A low-quality coffee, often used to cut costs. |
| Ecology or sustainability labels | Not bad in itself, but their expensive price and administrative burden make them limited to large industrial producers. |
| Tradition | A strong marketing argument around tradition or heritage. (e.g. « since 19xx ») |
| Masculinity | A strong marketing argument around masculinity and virility.
| Notes | If related to « dark », « intense », « strong ». Indicates a burnt and low-quality coffee. |

To help you better understand, let's take a look at three labels from different roasters :<side-note class="xl:-mt-90"><SideImage src={GoodLabel} alt="Good label" markers={[ { key: "1", legend: "Resealable zipper.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "50", top: "18" },{key: "2", legend: "More than just a country, the name of the farm and farmer.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "46.5", top: "38.5" },{key: "3", legend: "Processing method.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "30", top: "49.75" },{key: "4", legend: "Variety.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "40", top: "48.5" },{key: "5", legend: "Fruit notes.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "49", top: "49.75" },{key: "6", legend: "Roast date.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "58.5", top: "47.5" },{key: "7", legend: "Gas release valve on the back.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "95", top: "55" }]}/></side-note>

The first one is from Frukt Coffee Roaster, a local speciality roaster in Turku, Finland. It checks all the green flags, from the resealable zipper to transparent supply chain, which shows the roaster's commitment to quality and sustainability. This is expected from premium speciality roasters, and you can almost always trust them to deliver a great cup of coffee.<side-note class="xl:-mt-7"><SideImage src={MidLabel} alt="Mid label" markers={[{key: "1", legend: "Resealable zipper.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "50", top: "15" },{key: "2", legend: "Blend.", color: "oklch(76.9% 0.188 70.08)", left: "56", top: "74.25" },{key: "3", legend: "Chocolate and nuts notes.", color: "oklch(76.9% 0.188 70.08)", left: "52", top: "79.5" },{key: "4", legend: "A region slot, but empty?", color: "oklch(76.9% 0.188 70.08)", left: "53", top: "85" },{key: "5", legend: "Altitude.", color: "oklch(76.9% 0.188 70.08)", left: "71.5", top: "84.75" },{key: "6", legend: "Robusta.", left: "37", top: "87.75" },{key: "7", legend: "Processing method.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "53", top: "90" },{key: "8", legend: "Intensity scale.", color: "oklch(76.9% 0.188 70.08)", left: "72", top: "89.5" },{key: "9", legend: "Roast date.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "41", top: "93.5" },{key: "10", legend: "Gas release valve on the back.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "90", top: "50" },]} /></side-note>

The second one is a more complex case. It came from Coffee Lab—a local roaster in the suburbs of Toulouse, France—and clearly has a lot of orange flags, and even robusta! But we also see quality packaging (resealable zipper, gas release valve) and transparent information (roast date, processing method, region)... You're probably dealing with a decent or even good roaster, but this specific coffee in their lineup is aimed at a non-enthusiast or professional audience, which expects a more « traditional » coffee. This is more likely in the suburbs or countryside, where the speciality customer base is smaller.<side-note><SideImage src={BadLabel} alt="Bad label" markers={[ { key: "1", legend: "« Assemblage » is a blend in French.", color: "oklch(76.9% 0.188 70.08)", left: "66.25", top: "60.6" },{key: "2", legend: "Tradition marketing.", left: "64", top: "65.5" },{key: "3", legend: "Robusta.", left: "60.25", top: "68.75" },{key: "4", legend: "« robust », or any « intense » related notes.", left: "59", top: "74.75" },{key: "5", legend: "Intensity scale.", color: "oklch(76.9% 0.188 70.08)", left: "61", top: "77.5" },{key: "6", legend: "Ecology or sustainability labels.", left: "68", top: "87" },]} /></side-note>

The last one is a typical industrial coffee label in France. It has a lot of red and orange flags, but more importantly, it has no green flags. None of the information is useful to understand the coffee. It's a blend, with no origin, no processing method, and no roast date. This is a clear sign of low-quality coffee, and I would avoid it at all costs.

### Notes and processing methods

<Asterism />

Once you've identified some promising coffees, you can start exploring their flavor profiles through the notes provided on the label. Of course, you can simply choose whatever sounds appealing to you at the moment, but you can also kind of « reverse engineer » the notes to better understand some of the coffee's characteristics.

For example, if you imagine a scale like  citrus / berries / stone fruits / tropical fruits, you can expect more acidity on the left, and more sweetness while moving to the right. Similarly, honey or caramel notes suggest a full-bodied coffee with some sweetness, while butter or other dairy notes indicate a full-bodied with a more lipid texture. Nutty or chocolate notes often suggest a more bitter with some sweetness, but often with less flavor complexity.

Another important indicator is the processing method, which—as said earlier—refers to how coffee cherries are handled after harvesting, and can significantly influence the final flavor profile. Here are the most common methods you'll encounter:

* **Washed** (Wet): After removing the outer fruit pulp mechanically, beans undergo fermentation to break down the remaining mucilage, followed by thorough washing before drying. This method typically yields coffees with bright acidity, clarity, and clean, distinct flavor notes hightlighting their terroir.
* **Natural** (Dry): Cherries are dried whole under the sun, allowing fruit sugars to infuse into the bean. This process often results in a sweeter, fuller-bodied coffee with pronounced fruity notes, or even wine-like characteristics.
* **Honey** (Semi-washed): A hybrid process where the cherry skin is removed, but varying amounts of the mucilage are left on during drying. White/Yellow honey retains minimal mucilage, producing profiles closer to washed coffees with lighter sweetness and subtle fruity or floral notes; while red/black honey retains more mucilage, leading to sweeter, and syrupy flavors.

Additionally, you can come across specialized fermentation techniques,<sup>1</sup> which are increasingly popular among specialty roasters. These methodes are used to create unique and « funky » flavor profiles, while adding more value for the farmers / cooperatives (by adding a transformation step on their side), but also completely hide the original flavors of the beans. Here are some of the most common:<side-note class="draft">1 — Talk about the podcast of fermentation techniques.</side-note>

| Techniques | Description
|:-------------|:------------|
| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-primary rounded-full inline-block" /> Anaerobic | Cherries sealed in oxygen-free tanks to intensify fermentation, with tropical fruits or fermented beverages notes. |
| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-primary rounded-full inline-block" /> Carbonic | Cherries sealed in oxygen-free tanks flushed with <abbr>CO₂</abbr>, wine-like maceration with candy-like notes. |
| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-primary rounded-full inline-block" /> Nitrogen | Cherries sealed in oxygen-free tanks flushed with <abbr>N₂</abbr>, clean and bright acidity. |
| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-primary rounded-full inline-block" /> Nitro-washed | Cherries washed with nitrogen-saturated water, didn't taste enough to describe. |
| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-warning [clip-path:polygon(50%_0,100%_50%,50%_100%,0_50%)] inline-block" /> Yeast | Selected wine/bread yeasts added to guide fermentation kinetics, varies widely depending on yeast strain. |
| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-warning [clip-path:polygon(50%_0,100%_50%,50%_100%,0_50%)] inline-block" /> Lactic | De-pulped coffee inoculated with lactobacillus at low temperature, creamy sweetness (yogurt / butterscotch) and softened acidity. |
| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-warning [clip-path:polygon(50%_0,100%_50%,50%_100%,0_50%)] inline-block" /> Koji | Aspergillus oryzae mold inoculated to enhance umami and sweetness, rich and savory notes reminiscent of miso or soy sauce. |
| <span class="whitespace-nowrap"><span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-success inline-block" /> Thermal Shock</span> | Beans undergo hot-then-cold water “shock” during/after fermentation, jammy fruity notes and heightened sweetness. |
| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-success inline-block" /> Cryo / Freeze | Cherries frozen or near-zero-°C mid-process, slowing microbes and concentrating sugars, candy-like. |
| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-info [clip-path:polygon(25%_0,75%_0,100%_50%,75%_100%,25%_100%,0_50%)] inline-block" /> Fruit Infusion | Fruit pulp or purée added to the fermentation tank, intense infused fruit notes, sometimes a bit « artificial ». |
| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-info [clip-path:polygon(25%_0,75%_0,100%_50%,75%_100%,25%_100%,0_50%)] inline-block" /> Cacao Infusion | Cacao purée added to the fermentation tank, intense chocolate notes and perfumed aroma. |

<p class="legend">Legend: <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-primary rounded-full inline-block" /> Inert-Gas Anaerobic, <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-warning [clip-path:polygon(50%_0,100%_50%,50%_100%,0_50%)] inline-block" /> Starter-Driven Fermentations, <br/><span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-success inline-block" /> Thermal-Modulated, <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-info [clip-path:polygon(25%_0,75%_0,100%_50%,75%_100%,25%_100%,0_50%)] inline-block" /> Co-Fermentations.</p>

Some coffees made for competitions<sup>2</sup> are often processed with a combination of these techniques, like a double anaerobic fermentation with fruit infusion, or a thermal shock followed by a yeast inoculation... While these coffees can be incredibly complex and unique, with an amazing extraction potential, they can also be quite expensive and not always available in your area.<side-note class="draft">2 — Maybe explain what is a barrista competition briefly ?

### Coffee and equipment

<Asterism />

<draft-section>

Blablabla. It's cool to buy equipment from local roasters and coffee shops. Usually it's not that more expensive than Amazon... But check the prices first, some clearly are scams.

Check my previous article for the basics.

You don't need to buy a lot of equipment, nor fancy stuff. Good quality equipment that are simple and reliable.

## Local roasters in Finland

In my previous article, I recommended some of <a href="/2023/discovering-coffee-toulouse/">my favorite coffee roasters</a> in Toulouse, France. Since then, I've explored Finland and fallen in love not only with the country, but also with its vibrant coffee scene and ultra-light roasts. Here are some of my favorite spot, but keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list!<sup>1</sup><side-note>1 — Roasters still on my radar include <a href="https://siemasu.coffee/">Siemasu</a> and <a href="https://pirkanmaanpaahtimo.fi/">Pirkanmaan Paahtimo</a> in Tampere, and <a href="https://www.makeacoffee.fi/">Makea</a> in Haparanda, which I hope to try soon.</side-note>

### Frukt Coffee (Turku)
<MapsBlock id="ChIJCxSBfgd3jEYRQNtJr-JFYD4" />

With their new coffee shop located halfway between the train station and the city center, Frukt Coffee is a must-visit in Turku. Samuli and Miska are truly passionate and lovely people, and offer exceptional hand-brewed coffees from Latin America,<sup>2</sup> with a strong emphasis on quality and sustainability. The pastries and atmosphere are also nice, even if the place is a bit small.<side-note>2 — Several of their coffees come from <a href="https://lareb.co/">La Real Expedición Botánica</a> through Carlos from Hayuco, one of my favorite roaster in Toulouse. Tasting the same exact coffee roasted by two different roasters is a rare and fascinating experience!</side-note>

### Kahiwa Coffee Roasters (Lahti)
<MapsBlock id="ChIJSSYlxg0pjkYRciGtaq85ogI" />

Between two grand prix, Valtteri Bottas invested in Kahiwa Coffee Roasters, a local roaster in Lahti. And with their diverse selection of coffees, amazing pastries, and cozy atmosphere, I understand why! The barista was super fun to talk with, and I really loved their aeropress competition coffees. I didn't try their new « Piano » coffee-wine-restaurant place yet, but it looks very promising.

### Good Life Coffee (Helsinki)
<MapsBlock id="ChIJ6Q0D1X4JkkYR5oCaztwMtV4" />

Good Life Coffee is a well-known and beloved coffee roaster in Helsinki, celebrated for its light but balanced roasts, and strong focus on quality sourcing. Sadly they no longer run their own counter, but you can find their coffees in Sävy, a lovely coffee shop with a delicious pastries, super friendly baristas—kiitos for tolerating my broken Finnish—and hosting regular events, including cupping sessions with local roasters.

### Maja Coffee Roastery (Helsinki)
<MapsBlock id="ChIJe1IZRfX1jUYRVcqmVQOb9iY" />

Kultuurisauna is a beautiful modern public sauna, gender separated and naked, with dimmed lights, relaxing atmosphere, and stunning Japanese/Finnish architecture. In the common area—gender mixed and in swimsuits—you can cool down in the sea, borrow a mug to drink water, or try Maja Coffee Roastery coffees. They have a little selection of african coffees, and only serve filter coffee. Truly a out of time experience.
