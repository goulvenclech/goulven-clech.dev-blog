## Basics of speciality coffee

T**he pandemic has changed our morning coffee**. By revealing how deeply our daily routines impact our mental health and well-being, it inspired many of us to explore *specialty coffee* for the first time.

Two years ago, to show that it can be much more than a bitter pick-me-up, I shared my own journey in <a>*Discovering Coffee in Toulouse*</a>. Since then, I've continually been amazed by all the passionate people, amazing events, and delicious coffees I've encountered. Even more gratifying, my beginner’s gear recommendations have encouraged a few newcomers to dive into this fascinating world.

Yet, I understand that specialty coffee can seem intimidating, filled with obscure terms and concepts that might seem a bit snobbish. That's why I'm excited to share more of what I've learned, beginning with my personal cheat sheet—a quick guide to help you better understand, buy, and enjoy coffee.

I hope you find it helpful!

### Beans' journey

<Asterism />

Coffee *cherries*—the fruit containing our precious beans—grow on trees from the *Coffea* family, whose main representatives are *Coffea arabica* and *Coffea canephora* (commonly known as *robusta*). Other species make up only a small percentage of global coffee production.<sup>1</sup><side-note class="xl:-mt-8">1 — Honorable mention for *Coffea liberica*, once cultivated for its resistance to fungal diseases, but now only marginally grown in certain parts of West Africa and Southeast Asia; And *Coffea stenophylla*, a long forgoten West African species, which has recently drawn attention for its promising cup quality and natural heat tolerance, making it a potential candidate for climate-resilient coffee ☞ <a href="https://youtu.be/iGL7LtgC_0I">About Stenophylla</a></side-note>

Coffea arabica requires a relatively warm climate without frost, but with abundant rainfall, good ventilation, and cool nights. These conditions are primarily found at higher altitudes, in mountains or tropical plateaus, as well as on some islands within the *coffee belt*—between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. This climate slows cherry maturation, promoting the development of fine and complex aromas.

Less demanding, robusta coffee grows at lower altitudes (200 to 800 meters) where temperatures can reach up to 30°C. It also withstands higher humidity, diseases, and climatic variations. These traits make robusta well-suited to hot and humid tropical plains, particularly in West Africa and Southeast Asia. But less aromatic and higher in caffeine, robusta is primarily used to cut costs in industrial coffee blends.

*Harvests* can be handpicked—essential for specialty coffee—or mechanical, quicker but less precise. After harvesting, cherries undergo *processing*, a critical step that shapes the coffee's final flavor profile. They can be fully washed to remove their skin and pulp, dried naturally in the sun with their pulp still intact, or fermented in tanks to enhance flavors. The drying process typically involves spreading cherries or beans on raised beds, patios, or mechanical dryers, carefully managed to achieve consistent moisture levels essential for quality.<side-note class="xl:-mt-100"><SideImage src={FarmerDryingCoffee} alt="Farmer drying coffee" />A farmer is drying coffee beans in the sun. Antigua, Guatemala, Central America.</side-note>

Once processed, coffee beans are carefully sorted and selected based on quality criteria such as size, density, and defect levels. Specialty coffee buyers often visit farms or cooperatives directly to taste and evaluate beans before purchase. Beans are then packaged and transported—usually by sea—to roasters around the world.

### Economics of coffee

<Asterism />

Often, people visiting specialty coffee shops for the first time are surprised to see an espresso priced over 2€, compared to the 1.50€ they'd pay at a chain, or 0.50€ at a vending machine. But considering the steps, the people involved, and kilometers traveled, how can coffee remain this cheap and still be sustainable? It simply can't.

After the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement's *quota system* in 1989, the removal of export quotas unleashed massive stockpiles and encouraged aggressive production expansions—especially in Brazil and Vietnam. This surge drove coffee prices to historically low levels, often below production costs.<sup>1</sup> Although occasional price spikes occurred due to severe weather events,<sup>2</sup> coffee prices have consistently failed to keep pace with global inflation. As a result, real prices steadily declined over three decades, creating an economic crisis for millions of smallholder coffee farmers, especially in Latin America and Africa.<sup>3</sup><side-note class="xl:-mt-64"><SideImage src={CoffeePricesHistorical} alt="ça monte pas" />1 — TODO: make a graph with the evolution of <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2535/coffee-prices-historical-chart-data">coffee prices</a> between 1980 and 2010. With a vertical line for the 1989 collapse and gray areas for price spikes.</side-note><side-note>2 — Such as in 1994, 1997, and 2010.</side-note><side-note>3 — « [...] although the coffee business is booming in consuming developed countries, current rock bottom prices are causing immense hardship to countries where coffee is a key economic activity, as well as to the farmers who produce it. » ☞ Osorio N (2002). *The coffee crisis: a threat to sustainable development*. International Coffee Organization <a href="https://www.ico.org/documents/ed1849.pdf">Source</a></side-note>

Despite this « silent crisis », no global coffee price crisis visibly disrupted consumer markets before the COVID-19 pandemic. But then, coffee prices have surged to historic highs by 2025<sup>4</sup> due to climatic, economic, and geopolitical factors. Climatically, the 2021 severe frost in Brazil, the 2023 drought in Vietnam, and the 2024 poor harvests in Indonesia have significantly reduced coffee yields, especially for robusta. Economically, sustained global demand, heightened market speculation, and rising costs for fertilizers, energy, and shipping—exacerbated by the war in Ukraine—have further inflated prices. Although a moderate price easing is anticipated beyond 2025, the long-term outlook remains volatile due to ongoing climate risks and sustained demand growth, especially in emerging markets (e.g., China, India).<sup>5</sup><side-note>4 — TODO: make a graph with the evolution of <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2535/coffee-prices-historical-chart-data">coffee prices</a> between 2010 and 2025.

price developments*. FAO <a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/b7f6d358-01b9-4545-876f-962382d71af9">Source</a></side-note>

Of course, specialty coffee isn't immune to these challenges: roasters and farmers have to face rising production, labor, and living costs, and profound changes and investments will be necessary to tackle climate change. But by prioritizing quality over quantity, specialty coffee supports more sustainable practices and encourages a healthier market dynamic, benefiting farmers, consumers, and the environment alike. And I believe that worths paying a bit more for a cup of coffee.

### Health impacts

<Asterism />

In addition to being economically and environmentally sustainable, coffee must also be safe for us. And if caffeine was once feared and wrongly blamed for a range of health issues, over the past two decades, scientific research has brought a major shift in how coffee is viewed nutritionally.

Large-scale studies and meta-analyses suggest that moderate coffee consumption (typically 2 to 4 cups a day) is linked to a lower risk of several chronic diseases,<sup>1</sup> including type 2 diabetes,<sup>2</sup> heart diseases,<sup>3</sup> and even some forms of cancer.<sup>4</sup> There's also growing evidence that regular coffee drinkers may have a reduced risk of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease.<sup>5</sup>
<side-note class="xl:-mt-60">1 — Individuals with higher coffee intake had a 14% reduction risk for all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.92) ☞ Je Y, Giovannucci E (2014). *Coffee consumption and total mortality: a meta-analysis of twenty prospective cohort studies*. Br J Nutr <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24279995/">Source</a></side-note><side-note class="xl:-mt-24">2 — Approximately 4 cups of coffee per day is associated with a 21% reduction in all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.72-0.87) ☞ Shahinfar & al (2021). *Coffee consumption and cardiovascular diseases and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of cohort studies*.

Eur J Cancer Prev <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28288025/">Source</a></side-note><side-note>5 — Approximately 3 cups of coffee per day was linked to a 28% lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.65-0.81) ☞ Qi H, Li S (2014). *Dose-response meta-analysis on coffee, tea and caffeine consumption with risk of Parkinson's disease*. Geriatr Gerontol Int <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23879665/">Source</a></side-note>

These associations don't necessarily prove that coffee causes these health benefits, but the consistency of the findings across many different populations and study designs makes the evidence quite robust. Researchers also point to biological mechanisms that may explain these effects, including the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and insulin-sensitizing properties of compounds naturally present in coffee.

Of course, coffee isn't risk-free. It can interfere with your sleep,<sup>6</sup> increase anxiety,<sup>7</sup> and — during pregnancy — raise the risk of low birth weight or miscarriage.<sup>8</sup> But for the average healthy adult, the current consensus is clear: <u>coffee is more likely to benefit your health than to harm it.</u><side-note>6 — Caffeine consumption significantly reduces sleep quality by shortening total sleep time, lowering efficiency, and increasing time to fall asleep and nighttime wakefulness. To avoid these effects, it should be consumed 9-13 hours before bedtime, depending on the dose. ☞ Gardiner C & al (2023). *The effect of caffeine on subsequent sleep: A systematic review and meta-analysis*.

- **Natural** - Fruity, sweet, heavy.
- **Honey** - In between.
- **Anaerobic** - Funky, fermented.
- Buzz word related fermentation or yeasts - Fermented +++
- Buzz word like "Funky", "Mystic", "Signature" - Means nothing.

Washed (Wet) Process: Cherries are pulped to remove the fruit, then fermented to break down any remaining mucilage, and finally washed with water. This method typically yields clean, bright, and consistent flavor profiles.

Natural (Dry) Process: Cherries dry naturally in the sun, allowing sugars from the fruit to infuse into the bean, resulting in sweeter, fruitier flavors.

Honey (Semi-washed) Process: A hybrid approach where the fruit skin is removed but some mucilage remains during drying, balancing sweetness and acidity.

### Tastes, aromas, and flavors

<Asterism />

To better understand the tasting process, it's essential to clearly distinguish between « *taste* » and « *aromas* ». Simply put, taste refers to the basic sensations perceived by our tongue—sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami【Chen et al., 2023】. On the other hand, aromas are perceived through our nose, capturing the volatile compounds that give coffee its rich, layered bouquet—those floral, fruity, nutty, or chocolaty nuances we love【Mayer et al., Specialty Coffee Association】.

Together, taste and aromas form what sensory science calls « *flavours* ». But flavours are even broader: they're a blend of our direct sensory impressions combined with the context and experience around the drink【Spence, 2020】. When you sip your coffee, everything from temperature and texture to your mood, expectations, the setting, and even cultural habits influence your perception【Dotson et al., 2016】. Drinking an espresso in a lively café among friends can taste profoundly different from drinking the exact same coffee alone, in silence, at home【Spence, 2020】.

This complexity explains why, in specialty coffee (just like in wine tasting), we describe "notes." When we speak about notes of strawberry, caramel, or jasmine, we don't mean the coffee literally tastes exactly like those foods. Instead, we're referencing memory snapshots of those flavours, subtle reminders or echoes that our brain associates with previous tasting experiences【Chen et al., 2023】.

These notes become clearer and more precise through practice. By consciously tasting and comparing different coffees regularly, your sensory vocabulary expands【Mayer et al., Specialty Coffee Association】. You become increasingly skilled at identifying subtle aromas, recalling flavour memories, and expressing your experience in words. Ultimately, developing your tasting skills is not about detecting literal tastes, but rather sharpening your ability to interpret and communicate the rich, subjective world of flavour【Chen et al., 2023.

### Tasting at home

<Asterism />

Do I really like it? What do I like about it? What do I dislike about it?

It's just bitter, sour, and woody? -> Maybe try speciality coffe, read my previous article.

I buy speciality coffee, but it's:
- Bitter -> Grind coarser, brew shorter.
- Sour -> Grind finer, brew longer.
- Watery -> Brew longer.
- Too strong -> Brew shorter.
- Too fermented/boring -> Try another process.
- Woody -> Try another roaster.

Reads the notes on the label, and try to find what the roaster meant.

### Tasting at cuppings

<Asterism />

No good or wrong answer.

Don't overthink the first sip. Opinions come from comparison, so try the second one and ask yourself :

- Do I like it?
- Is it more acidic than the previous one?
- Is it more bitter?
- Is it more sweet?
- Is it fermented?

From there, you can even try to put words on what you taste.

- If it's acidic and sweet, is it fruity? Like stone fruits or berries?
- If it's more acidic than sweet, is it more like citrus or like vinegar?
- If it's more bitter than sweet, is it more like chocolate or like burnt toast?
... etc.

Use the coffee wheel to help you find the right words.
