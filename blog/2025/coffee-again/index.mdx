## Basics of speciality coffee

S**ince my first steps in the coffee world**, I've been amazed by the passionate people I've encountered, always eager to share their knowledge and love for coffee. One of small but proudest moments was seeing my first article—especially the gear list—help others get into specialty coffee, and then watch them share it with others.

Two years later, I want to share some of the knowledge I’ve gathered as a passionate enthusiast. Think of it as a mini personal knowledge base, a cheat sheet, or a quick guide to the key things to know to better understand, buy, and enjoy specialty coffee.

Blablabla.

### Health impacts

<Asterism />

If caffeine was once feared and wrongly blamed for a range of health issues, over the past two decades, scientific research has brought a major shift in how coffee is viewed nutritionally.

Large-scale studies and meta-analyses suggest that moderate coffee consumption (typically 2 to 4 cups a day) is linked to a lower risk of several chronic diseases,<sup>1</sup> including type 2 diabetes,<sup>2</sup> heart diseases,<sup>3</sup> and even some forms of cancer.<sup>4</sup> There's also growing evidence that regular coffee drinkers may have a reduced risk of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease.<sup>5</sup>
<side-note class="xl:-mt-60">1 — Individuals with higher coffee intake had a 14% reduction risk for all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.92) ☞ Je Y, Giovannucci E (2014). *Coffee consumption and total mortality: a meta-analysis of twenty prospective cohort studies*. Br J Nutr <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24279995/">Source</a></side-note><side-note class="xl:-mt-24">2 — Approximately 4 cups of coffee per day is associated with a 21% reduction in all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.72-0.87) ☞ Shahinfar & al (2021). *Coffee consumption and cardiovascular diseases and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of cohort studies*. Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34112583/">Source</a></side-note><side-note>3 — Approximately 3 cups of coffee or tea per day is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases and improved survival ☞ Chieng D, Kistler PM (2022). *Coffee and tea on cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention*. Trends Cardiovasc Med <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34384881/">Source</a></side-note><side-note>4 — Coffee consumption is not associated with an increased risk of cancer (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.99-1.01) and it is linked to a reduced risk of specific cancers, particularly liver (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.81-0.90) and endometrial cancer (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.88-0.96) ☞ Alicandro G & al (2017). *Coffee and cancer risk: a summary overview*. Eur J Cancer Prev <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28288025/">Source</a></side-note><side-note>5 — Approximately 3 cups of coffee per day was linked to a 28% lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.65-0.81) ☞ Qi H, Li S (2014). *Dose-response meta-analysis on coffee, tea and caffeine consumption with risk of Parkinson's disease*. Geriatr Gerontol Int <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23879665/">Source</a></side-note>

These associations don't necessarily prove that coffee causes these health benefits, but the consistency of the findings across many different populations and study designs makes the evidence quite robust. Researchers also point to biological mechanisms that may explain these effects, including the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and insulin-sensitizing properties of compounds naturally present in coffee.

Of course, coffee isn't risk-free. It can interfere with your sleep,<sup>6</sup> increase anxiety,<sup>7</sup> and — during pregnancy — raise the risk of low birth weight or miscarriage.<sup>8</sup> But for the average healthy adult, the current consensus is clear: <u>coffee is more likely to benefit your health than to harm it.</u><side-note>6 — Caffeine consumption significantly reduces sleep quality by shortening total sleep time, lowering efficiency, and increasing time to fall asleep and nighttime wakefulness. To avoid these effects, it should be consumed 9-13 hours before bedtime, depending on the dose. ☞ Gardiner C & al (2023). *The effect of caffeine on subsequent sleep: A systematic review and meta-analysis*. Sleep Med Rev <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23319909/">Source</a></side-note><side-note>7 — Caffeine intake increases anxiety levels (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.42-0.79) with doses above 400mg having a much stronger effect (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 2.50-3.22) ☞ Liu C & al (2024). *Caffeine intake and anxiety: a meta-analysis*.

## Buying coffee

Blablabla.

### Find a local roaster

### How to read the label

<Asterism />

Green flags : Roast date; Precise origin; Notes related to fruits or flowers; resealable zipper.

Red flags : Robusta. Notes related to "dark", "intense", "strong", "nuts", "cerals"; Intensity scale. A strong marketing argument around tradition or heritage.

What's not useful : Altitude; Variety (ish); Roast color (ish).

Blends vs single origins.

Process:
- **Washed** - Clean, bright, acidic.
- **Natural** - Fruity, sweet, heavy.
- **Honey** - In between.
- **Anaerobic** - Funky, fermented.
- Buzz word related fermentation or yeasts - Fermented +++
- Buzz word like "Funky", "Mystic", "Signature" - Means nothing.

## Tasting coffee

### Tastes, aromas, and flavors

<Asterism />

To better understand the tasting process, it's essential to clearly distinguish between « *taste* » and « *aromas* ». Simply put, taste refers to the basic sensations perceived by our tongue—sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami【Chen et al., 2023】. On the other hand, aromas are perceived through our nose, capturing the volatile compounds that give coffee its rich, layered bouquet—those floral, fruity, nutty, or chocolaty nuances we love【Mayer et al., Specialty Coffee Association】.

Together, taste and aromas form what sensory science calls « *flavours* ». But flavours are even broader: they're a blend of our direct sensory impressions combined with the context and experience around the drink【Spence, 2020】. When you sip your coffee, everything from temperature and texture to your mood, expectations, the setting, and even cultural habits influence your perception【Dotson et al., 2016】. Drinking an espresso in a lively café among friends can taste profoundly different from drinking the exact same coffee alone, in silence, at home【Spence, 2020】.

This complexity explains why, in specialty coffee (just like in wine tasting), we describe "notes." When we speak about notes of strawberry, caramel, or jasmine, we don't mean the coffee literally tastes exactly like those foods. Instead, we're referencing memory snapshots of those flavours, subtle reminders or echoes that our brain associates with previous tasting experiences【Chen et al., 2023】.

These notes become clearer and more precise through practice. By consciously tasting and comparing different coffees regularly, your sensory vocabulary expands【Mayer et al., Specialty Coffee Association】. You become increasingly skilled at identifying subtle aromas, recalling flavour memories, and expressing your experience in words. Ultimately, developing your tasting skills is not about detecting literal tastes, but rather sharpening your ability to interpret and communicate the rich, subjective world of flavour【Chen et al., 2023.


### Demistify the sommelier

Demistify the wine pro taster.

About the words.

About the origins.

### Tasting at home

<Asterism />

Do I really like it? What do I like about it? What do I dislike about it?

It's just bitter, sour, and woody? -> Maybe try speciality coffe, read my previous article.

I buy speciality coffee, but it's:
- Bitter -> Grind coarser, brew shorter.
- Sour -> Grind finer, brew longer.
- Watery -> Brew longer.
- Too strong -> Brew shorter.
- Too fermented/boring -> Try another process.
- Woody -> Try another roaster.

Reads the notes on the label, and try to find what the roaster meant.

## Blind cupping

Blablabla. Why and how to find cuppings in your area.

### Cheat sheet

<Asterism />

White cups with numbers (to avoid bias). Smell the dry coffee. Smell the wet coffee. Break the crust. Clean the cup. Smell again. Taste. Spit. Rate.

Recipe: 8.25g coffee, 150g water, 96°C, 4 minutes.

Tutorial on how to break the crust and clean the cup.

### Tasting at cuppings

<Asterism />

No good or wrong answer.

Don't overthink the first sip. Opinions come from comparison, so try the second one and ask yourself :

- Do I like it?
- Is it more acidic than the previous one?
- Is it more bitter?
- Is it more sweet?
- Is it fermented?

From there, you can even try to put words on what you taste.

- If it's acidic and sweet, is it fruity? Like stone fruits or berries?
- If it's more acidic than sweet, is it more like citrus or like vinegar?
- If it's more bitter than sweet, is it more like chocolate or like burnt toast?
... etc.

Use the coffee wheel to help you find the right words.
