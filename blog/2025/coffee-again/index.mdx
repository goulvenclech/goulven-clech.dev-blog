## Basics of speciality coffee

T**he pandemic has changed our morning coffee**. By revealing how deeply our daily routines impact our mental health and well-being, it inspired many of us to explore *specialty coffee* for the first time.

Two years ago, to show that it can be much more than a bitter pick-me-up, I shared my own journey in <a>*Discovering Coffee in Toulouse*</a>. Since then, I've continually been amazed by all the passionate people, amazing events, and delicious coffees I've encountered. Even more gratifying, my beginner’s gear recommendations have encouraged a few newcomers to dive into this fascinating world.

Yet, I understand that specialty coffee can seem intimidating, filled with obscure terms and concepts that might seem a bit snobbish. That's why I'm excited to share more of what I've learned, beginning with my personal cheat sheet—a quick guide to help you better understand, buy, and enjoy coffee.

I hope you find it helpful!

### Beans' journey

<Asterism />

Coffee *cherries*—the fruit containing our precious beans—grow on trees from the *Coffea* family, whose main representatives are *Coffea arabica* and *Coffea canephora* (commonly known as *robusta*). Other species make up only a small percentage of global coffee production.<sup>1</sup><side-note class="xl:-mt-8">1 — Honorable mention for *Coffea liberica*, once cultivated for its resistance to fungal diseases, but now only marginally grown in certain parts of West Africa and Southeast Asia; And *Coffea stenophylla*, a long forgoten West African species, which has recently drawn attention for its promising cup quality and natural heat tolerance, making it a potential candidate for climate-resilient coffee ☞ <a href="https://youtu.be/iGL7LtgC_0I">About Stenophylla</a></side-note>

Coffea arabica requires a relatively warm climate without frost, but with abundant rainfall, good ventilation, and cool nights. These conditions are primarily found at higher altitudes, in mountains or tropical plateaus, as well as on some islands within the *coffee belt*—between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. This climate slows cherry maturation, promoting the development of fine and complex aromas.

Less demanding, robusta coffee grows at lower altitudes (200 to 800 meters) where temperatures can reach up to 30°C. It also withstands higher humidity, diseases, and climatic variations. These traits make robusta well-suited to hot and humid tropical plains, particularly in West Africa and Southeast Asia. But less aromatic and higher in caffeine, robusta is primarily used to cut costs in industrial coffee blends.

*Harvests* can be handpicked—essential for specialty coffee—or mechanical, quicker but less precise. After harvesting, cherries undergo *processing*, a critical step that shapes the coffee's final flavor profile. They can be fully washed to remove their skin and pulp, dried naturally in the sun with their pulp still intact, or fermented in tanks to enhance flavors. The drying process typically involves spreading cherries or beans on raised beds, patios, or mechanical dryers, carefully managed to achieve consistent moisture levels essential for quality.<side-note class="xl:-mt-100"><SideImage src={FarmerDryingCoffee} alt="Farmer drying coffee" />A farmer is drying coffee beans in the sun. Antigua, Guatemala, Central America.</side-note>

Once processed, coffee beans are carefully sorted and selected based on quality criteria such as size, density, and defect levels. Specialty coffee buyers often visit farms or cooperatives directly to taste and evaluate beans before purchase. Beans are then packaged and transported—usually by sea—to roasters around the world.

### Economics of coffee

<Asterism />

Often, people visiting specialty coffee shops for the first time are surprised to see an espresso priced over 2€, compared to the 1.50€ they'd pay at a chain, or 0.50€ at a vending machine. But considering the steps, the people involved, and kilometers traveled, how can coffee remain this cheap and still be sustainable? It simply can't.

After the collapse of the International Coffee Agreement's *quota system* in 1989, the removal of export quotas unleashed massive stockpiles and encouraged aggressive production expansions—especially in Brazil and Vietnam. This surge drove coffee prices to historically low levels, often below production costs.<sup>1</sup> Although occasional price spikes occurred due to severe weather events,<sup>2</sup> coffee prices have consistently failed to keep pace with global inflation. As a result, real prices steadily declined over three decades, creating an economic crisis for millions of smallholder coffee farmers, especially in Latin America and Africa.<sup>3</sup><side-note class="xl:-mt-64"><SideImage src={CoffeePricesHistorical} alt="ça monte pas" />1 — TODO: make a graph with the evolution of <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2535/coffee-prices-historical-chart-data">coffee prices</a> between 1980 and 2010. With a vertical line for the 1989 collapse and gray areas for price spikes.</side-note><side-note>2 — Such as in 1994, 1997, and 2010.</side-note><side-note>3 — « [...] although the coffee business is booming in consuming developed countries, current rock bottom prices are causing immense hardship to countries where coffee is a key economic activity, as well as to the farmers who produce it. » ☞ Osorio N (2002). *The coffee crisis: a threat to sustainable development*. International Coffee Organization <a href="https://www.ico.org/documents/ed1849.pdf">Source</a></side-note>

Despite this « silent crisis », no global coffee price crisis visibly disrupted consumer markets before the COVID-19 pandemic. But then, coffee prices have surged to historic highs by 2025<sup>4</sup> due to climatic, economic, and geopolitical factors. Climatically, the 2021 severe frost in Brazil, the 2023 drought in Vietnam, and the 2024 poor harvests in Indonesia have significantly reduced coffee yields, especially for robusta. Economically, sustained global demand, heightened market speculation, and rising costs for fertilizers, energy, and shipping—exacerbated by the war in Ukraine—have further inflated prices. Although a moderate price easing is anticipated beyond 2025, the long-term outlook remains volatile due to ongoing climate risks and sustained demand growth, especially in emerging markets (e.g., China, India).<sup>5</sup><side-note>4 — TODO: make a graph with the evolution of <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/2535/coffee-prices-historical-chart-data">coffee prices</a> between 2010 and 2025. With a vertical line for the COVID-19 pandemic.</side-note><side-note>5 — Amrouk EM & al (2024). *Global coffee market and recent
price developments*. FAO <a href="https://openknowledge.fao.org/items/b7f6d358-01b9-4545-876f-962382d71af9">Source</a></side-note>

Of course, specialty coffee isn't immune to these challenges: roasters and farmers have to face rising production, labor, and living costs, and profound changes and investments will be necessary to tackle climate change. But by prioritizing quality over quantity, specialty coffee supports more sustainable practices and encourages a healthier market dynamic, benefiting farmers, consumers, and the environment alike. And I believe that worths paying a bit more for a cup of coffee.

### Economics of roasters

<Asterism />

Maybe talk about the economy of roasters and coffee shops?

### Health impacts

<Asterism />

In addition to being economically and environmentally sustainable, coffee must also be safe for us. And if caffeine was once feared and wrongly blamed for a range of health issues, over the past two decades, scientific research has brought a major shift in how coffee is viewed nutritionally.

Large-scale studies and meta-analyses suggest that moderate coffee consumption (typically 2 to 4 cups a day) is linked to a lower risk of several chronic diseases,<sup>1</sup> including type 2 diabetes,<sup>2</sup> heart diseases,<sup>3</sup> and even some forms of cancer.<sup>4</sup> There's also growing evidence that regular coffee drinkers may have a reduced risk of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease.<sup>5</sup>
<side-note class="xl:-mt-60">1 — Individuals with higher coffee intake had a 14% reduction risk for all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.92) ☞ Je Y, Giovannucci E (2014). *Coffee consumption and total mortality: a meta-analysis of twenty prospective cohort studies*. Br J Nutr <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24279995/">Source</a></side-note><side-note class="xl:-mt-24">2 — Approximately 4 cups of coffee per day is associated with a 21% reduction in all-cause mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.72-0.87) ☞ Shahinfar & al (2021). *Coffee consumption and cardiovascular diseases and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of cohort studies*. Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34112583/">Source</a></side-note><side-note>3 — Approximately 3 cups of coffee or tea per day is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases and improved survival ☞ Chieng D, Kistler PM (2022). *Coffee and tea on cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention*. Trends Cardiovasc Med <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34384881/">Source</a></side-note><side-note>4 — Coffee consumption is not associated with an increased risk of cancer (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.99-1.01) and it is linked to a reduced risk of specific cancers, particularly liver (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.81-0.90) and endometrial cancer (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.88-0.96) ☞ Alicandro G & al (2017). *Coffee and cancer risk: a summary overview*. Eur J Cancer Prev <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28288025/">Source</a></side-note><side-note>5 — Approximately 3 cups of coffee per day was linked to a 28% lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease (95% <abbr title="Confidence Interval">CI</abbr>: 0.65-0.81) ☞ Qi H, Li S (2014). *Dose-response meta-analysis on coffee, tea and caffeine consumption with risk of Parkinson's disease*. Geriatr Gerontol Int <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23879665/">Source</a></side-note>

These associations don't necessarily prove that coffee causes these health benefits, but the consistency of the findings across many different populations and study designs makes the evidence quite robust. Researchers also point to biological mechanisms that may explain these effects, including the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and insulin-sensitizing properties of compounds naturally present in coffee.

Of course, coffee isn't risk-free. It can interfere with your sleep,<sup>6</sup> increase anxiety,<sup>7</sup> and — during pregnancy — raise the risk of low birth weight or miscarriage.<sup>8</sup> But for the average healthy adult, the current consensus is clear: <u>coffee is more likely to benefit your health than to harm it.</u><side-note>6 — Caffeine consumption significantly reduces sleep quality by shortening total sleep time, lowering efficiency, and increasing time to fall asleep and nighttime wakefulness. To avoid these effects, it should be consumed 9-13 hours before bedtime, depending on the dose. ☞ Gardiner C & al (2023). *The effect of caffeine on subsequent sleep: A systematic review and meta-analysis*.

## Buying coffee

Blablabla. You can buy speciality coffee online, even on subscription format. It's useful if you are not in a big city, but it's also nice to go buy locally, and met your local scene.

Specialty coffee can be buy directly from roasters, which often have a counter or a coffee shop. You can also find it in specialty coffee shops, which often sales their roasters coffee, or a selection of roasters. I avoid coffees in supermarkets or convenience stores, as they are often low-quality coffee.

Look « speciality coffee » on Google Maps, and you will find a lot of shops. There is also dedicated websites, like <a href="https://europeancoffeetrip.com/">European Coffee Trip</a>, which offers a more selective list but sometimes outdated.

### The good and the bad label

<Asterism />

Before I dig into the label, I first scan the bag for quick cues that tell me whether it's worth a closer look. For example, here what I look for:

| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-success rounded-full inline-block" /> Green flags | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| Precise origin | More than just a country, but a region, a farm, or even a lot. Indicates a transparent supply chain and a single origin coffee. |
| Variety | Not useful for the average consumer, but indicates a transparent supply chain and a single origin coffee. |
| Processing method | Indicates the coffee's flavor profile, and the care taken in its production. |
| Roast date | Indicates the coffee's freshness. Industrial coffee often has a "best before" date, which is not the same. |
| Resealable zipper | Coffe is sensitive to air, light, and moisture. A resealable zipper helps preserve freshness. |
| Gas release valve | Freshly roasted coffee releases CO2, A gas release valve allows it to escape without letting air in. |
| Notes | If related to fruits, flowers, deserts, dairy products, or alcohols. Indicates a clean and complex coffee. |

Some cues aren't automatically good or bad, but are worth noting:

| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-warning rounded-full inline-block" /> Orange flags | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| Intensity scale | Purely subjective, and often misleading. |
| Roast color | Somehow subjective, and often misleading. |
| Altitudes | Useless information, and often misleading. |
| Blends | Can be great, but often used to hide low-quality coffee. |
| Notes | If related to chocolate, caramel, nuts, spices, or sweetness. May indicate a burnt coffee. |

On the other hand, a few signals almost always make me put the bag back on the shelf:

| <span class="h-2.5 w-2.5 bg-primary rounded-full inline-block" /> Red flags | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| Robusta | A low-quality coffee, often used to cut costs. |
| Ecology or sustainability labels | Not bad in itself, but their expensive price and administrative burden make them limited to large industrial producers. |
| Tradition | A strong marketing argument around tradition or heritage. (e.g. "since 19xx") |
| Masculinity | A strong marketing argument around masculinity and virility.
| Notes | If related to « dark », « intense », « strong ». Indicates a burnt and low-quality coffee. |

To help you better understand, let's take a look at three labels from different roasters :<side-note class="xl:-mt-90"><SideImage src={GoodLabel} alt="Good label" markers={[ { key: "1", legend: "Resealable zipper.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "50", top: "18" },{key: "2", legend: "More than just a country, the name of the farm and farmer.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "46.5", top: "38.5" },{key: "3", legend: "Processing method.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "30", top: "49.75" },{key: "4", legend: "Variety.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "40", top: "48.5" },{key: "5", legend: "Fruit notes.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "49", top: "49.75" },{key: "6", legend: "Roast date.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "58.5", top: "47.5" },{key: "7", legend: "Gas release valve on the back.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "95", top: "55" }]}/></side-note>

The first one is from Frukt Coffee Roaster, a local speciality roaster in Turku, Finland. It checks all the green flags, from the resealable zipper to transparent supply chain, which shows the roaster's commitment to quality and sustainability. This is expected from premium speciality roasters, and you can almost always trust them to deliver a great cup of coffee.<side-note class="xl:-mt-7"><SideImage src={MidLabel} alt="Mid label" markers={[{key: "1", legend: "Resealable zipper.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "50", top: "15" },{key: "2", legend: "Blend.", color: "oklch(66.6% 0.179 58.318)", left: "56", top: "74.25" },{key: "3", legend: "Chocolate and nuts notes.", color: "oklch(66.6% 0.179 58.318)", left: "52", top: "79.5" },{key: "4", legend: "A region slot, but empty?", color: "oklch(66.6% 0.179 58.318)", left: "53", top: "85" },{key: "5", legend: "Altitude.", color: "oklch(66.6% 0.179 58.318)", left: "71.5", top: "84.75" },{key: "6", legend: "Robusta.", left: "37", top: "87.75" },{key: "7", legend: "Processing method.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "53", top: "90" },{key: "8", legend: "Intensity scale.", color: "oklch(66.6% 0.179 58.318)", left: "72", top: "89.5" },{key: "9", legend: "Roast date.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "41", top: "93.5" },{key: "10", legend: "Gas release valve on the back.", color: "oklch(59.6% 0.145 163.225)", left: "90", top: "50" },]} /></side-note>

The second one is a more complex case. It came from Coffee Lab—a local roaster in the suburbs of Toulouse, France—and clearly has a lot of orange flags, and even robusta! But we also see quality packaging (resealable zipper, gas release valve) and transparent information (roast date, processing method, region)... You're probably dealing with a decent or even good roaster, but this specific coffee in their lineup is aimed at a non-enthusiast or professional audience, which expects a more « traditional » coffee. This is more likely in the suburbs or countryside, where the speciality customer base is smaller.<side-note><SideImage src={BadLabel} alt="Bad label" markers={[ { key: "1", legend: "« Assemblage » is a blend in French.", color: "oklch(66.6% 0.179 58.318)", left: "66.25", top: "60.6" },{key: "2", legend: "Tradition marketing.", left: "64", top: "65.5" },{key: "3", legend: "Robusta.", left: "60.25", top: "68.75" },{key: "4", legend: "« robust », or any « intense » related notes.", left: "59", top: "74.75" },{key: "5", legend: "Intensity scale.", color: "oklch(66.6% 0.179 58.318)", left: "61", top: "77.5" },{key: "6", legend: "Ecology or sustainability labels.", color: "oklch(66.6% 0.179 58.318)", left: "68", top: "87" },]} /></side-note>

The last one is a typical industrial coffee label in France. It has a lot of red and orange flags, but more importantly, it has no green flags. None of the information is useful to understand the coffee. It's a blend, with no origin, no processing method, and no roast date. This is a clear sign of low-quality coffee, and I would avoid it at all costs.

### How to read the label

<Asterism />

Blablabla.

Process:
- **Washed** - Clean, bright, acidic.
- **Natural** - Fruity, sweet, heavy.
- **Honey** - In between.
- **Anaerobic** - Funky, fermented.
- Buzz word related fermentation or yeasts - Fermented +++
- Buzz word like "Funky", "Mystic", "Signature" - Means nothing.

Washed (Wet) Process: Cherries are pulped to remove the fruit, then fermented to break down any remaining mucilage, and finally washed with water. This method typically yields clean, bright, and consistent flavor profiles.

Natural (Dry) Process: Cherries dry naturally in the sun, allowing sugars from the fruit to infuse into the bean, resulting in sweeter, fruitier flavors.

Honey (Semi-washed) Process: A hybrid approach where the fruit skin is removed but some mucilage remains during drying, balancing sweetness and acidity.

About Cascara.

### Coffee and equipment

<Asterism />

Blablabla. It's cool to buy equipment from local roasters and coffee shops. Usually it's not that more expensive than Amazon... But check the prices first, some clearly are scams.

Check my previous article for the basics.

You don't need to buy a lot of equipment, nor fancy stuff. Good quality equipment that are simple and reliable.

## Tasting coffee

Blabla. Demistify the wine pro taster.

About the words. About the origins.

In the end, it's about being able to put words on what you taste, both to help you understand your preferences and to share them with others.

### Tastes, aromas, and flavors

<Asterism />

To better understand the tasting process, it's essential to clearly distinguish between « *taste* » and « *aromas* ». Simply put, taste refers to the basic sensations perceived by our tongue—sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami【Chen et al., 2023】. On the other hand, aromas are perceived through our nose, capturing the volatile compounds that give coffee its rich, layered bouquet—those floral, fruity, nutty, or chocolaty nuances we love【Mayer et al., Specialty Coffee Association】.

Together, taste and aromas form what sensory science calls « *flavours* ». But flavours are even broader: they're a blend of our direct sensory impressions combined with the context and experience around the drink【Spence, 2020】. When you sip your coffee, everything from temperature and texture to your mood, expectations, the setting, and even cultural habits influence your perception【Dotson et al., 2016】. Drinking an espresso in a lively café among friends can taste profoundly different from drinking the exact same coffee alone, in silence, at home【Spence, 2020】.

This complexity explains why, in specialty coffee (just like in wine tasting), we describe "notes." When we speak about notes of strawberry, caramel, or jasmine, we don't mean the coffee literally tastes exactly like those foods. Instead, we're referencing memory snapshots of those flavours, subtle reminders or echoes that our brain associates with previous tasting experiences【Chen et al., 2023】.

These notes become clearer and more precise through practice. By consciously tasting and comparing different coffees regularly, your sensory vocabulary expands【Mayer et al., Specialty Coffee Association】. You become increasingly skilled at identifying subtle aromas, recalling flavour memories, and expressing your experience in words. Ultimately, developing your tasting skills is not about detecting literal tastes, but rather sharpening your ability to interpret and communicate the rich, subjective world of flavour【Chen et al., 2023.

### Tasting at home

<Asterism />

Do I really like it? What do I like about it? What do I dislike about it?

It's just bitter, sour, and woody? -> Maybe try speciality coffe, read my previous article.

I buy speciality coffee, but it's:
- Bitter -> Grind coarser, brew shorter.
- Sour -> Grind finer, brew longer.
- Watery -> Brew longer.
- Too strong -> Brew shorter.
- Too fermented/boring -> Try another process.
- Woody -> Try another roaster.

Reads the notes on the label, and try to find what the roaster meant.

### Tasting at coffeeshops

<Asterism />

Blablabla. Ask roasters for their coffee shops recommendations, or look for « speciality coffee » on Google Maps.

What you can order, what to expect.

It's easy to speak with baristas, and they love to share their knowledge.

Don't be a dick -> don't order complex stuff (one and one, V60, etc) or try to chit chat while they are on a rush.
-> don't compare negatively with others, or don't be means if the shot is bad (happens!)

### Espresso and latte art

<Asterism />

Blablabla. Why espresso and latte art are hard to do at home. Why you should probably enjoy them at a coffee shop.

## Blind cupping

Blablabla. Why and how to find cuppings in your area.

### How to cup

<Asterism />

White cups with numbers (to avoid bias). Smell the dry coffee. Smell the wet coffee. Break the crust. Clean the cup. Smell again. Taste. Spit. Rate.

Recipe: 8.25g coffee, 150g water, 96°C, 4 minutes.

Tutorial on how to break the crust and clean the cup.

### Tasting at cuppings

<Asterism />

No good or wrong answer.

Don't overthink the first sip. Opinions come from comparison, so try the second one and ask yourself :

- Do I like it?
- Is it more acidic than the previous one?
- Is it more bitter?
- Is it more sweet?
- Is it fermented?

From there, you can even try to put words on what you taste.

- If it's acidic and sweet, is it fruity? Like stone fruits or berries?
- If it's more acidic than sweet, is it more like citrus or like vinegar?
- If it's more bitter than sweet, is it more like chocolate or like burnt toast?
... etc.

Use the coffee wheel to help you find the right words.

## Local roasters in Finland

Blablabla. Let's have a word for roaster I didn't try yet, like Makea (Haparanda) or Siemasu (Tampere).
